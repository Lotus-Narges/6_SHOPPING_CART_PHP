## What's XSS (cross site scripting):
Cross site scripting (XSS) is an attack in which an attacker injects malicious executable scripts into the code of a trusted application or website. Attackers often initiate an XSS attack by sending a malicious link to a user and enticing the user to click it. If the app or website lacks proper data sanitization, the malicious link executes the attacker’s chosen code on the user’s system. As a result, the attacker can steal the user’s active session cookie.

## PHP Autoload function
the process of automatically loading PHP classes without explicitly loading them with the require() , require_once() , include() , or include_once() functions. 


## PHP Include
Include one PHP file into another PHP file. While including the content of the included file will be displayed in the main file.


## PHP Require
The PHP require function is similar to the include function. The only difference is that if the file is not found, it prevents the script from running, while include does not.


Syntax:

-include 'file_name';

or

-require 'file_name';
